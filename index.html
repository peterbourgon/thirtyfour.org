      <p>When we step into the world and become an anonymous extra, sonder to the lives of all those
        we see, we are in a fugue state, known only through the reflected gaze. In this isolation there
        is a safety, a sociocultural barrier. Sitting or walking or being alone, I am an autonomous and
        ambulatory actor, with purpose but without meaning. Here I can contemplate, like Atlas, and be
        contemplated in turn. Here I perceive my alienation most acutely: the infinite and fractal complexity
        of my own thoughts, projected outward as a blank stare, a bite of a sandwich, the occupation
        of space and nothing beyond.</p>
